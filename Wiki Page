Zone Control

  This app will be a mobile game where multiple people can play.  The game will display a map and have a capture point someplace on the map.  If the user moves to the point and hits the capture button first they will get a point for capturing the objective.  The game will end after a certain amount of time or after someone captures a certain amount of points

  The first step in making an app like this work is that I will have to establish a client server connection and be able to pass information back and forth easy.
